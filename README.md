This talk assumes no knowledge of Docker and only basic Go knowledge

1. What is Docker and why would I use it for development?
2. Using a Pre-Build image to edit and build Go code
3. Extending images with additional tools
4. Use multi-stage builds for testing
5. Using Docker-Compose for client and server testing

This is a beginner level talk. This talk will introduce Docker and why it's useful for developers in their daily life.
